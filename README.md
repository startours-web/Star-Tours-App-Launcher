# Star Tours App Launcher (code.org library)
Single-Sign-On (SSO) library to launch code.org applications using App Lab.

----
### Section 1 - Setup
Before we start, we must setup the variables, screens, and databases the launcher will be using.

**Step 1:** Start by creating a screen called `STAL_AUTH`. This is where all the authentication will be going on. All the UI is generated by the code itself.

**Step 2:** Now, we need to insert the variables. These will store the signed-in account username and password. You can change the variable names, if you want to.

```
var username;
var password;
```

**Step 3:** Lastly, you need to create the database that all the accounts will be stored in. Create a database and name it `accounts`. Then import this `csv` file into the database:
